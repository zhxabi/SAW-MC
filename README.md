# SAW-MC
This repository is for the PHYSICS 212 final project, "Monte-Carlo Simulations of Self-Avoiding Random Walks in 2 and 3 Dimensions Using the Pivot Method". 

The project implements the pivot algorithm for generating self-avoiding random walks (SAW) in 2 and 3 dimensions, and uses the model to examine critical exponents for SAWs. 

The full code is stored in `saw_local.ipynb`, which contain both the class and algorithm implementations, as well as the simulations and results. 

The code can be run with required packages by building a new conda environment from `environment.yaml`, with the commands
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate saw2d_env
```
